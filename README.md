## Hi there! 👋 I'm Kamil Klofczynski

Welcome to my GitHub! I’ve been on an exciting journey into full-stack web development since 2022, and I’m loving every minute of it. What started as a curiosity quickly turned into a deep passion for building web applications that are not only functional but also enjoyable to use.

### 🚀 About Me
I'm all about diving into projects from start to finish—planning, coding, testing, deploying, and keeping everything running smoothly. While I’m still early in my professional journey, I’ve been working hard on personal projects and learning as much as I can every day.

I enjoy turning ideas into reality with code and am constantly exploring new technologies and best practices to enhance my skills. Whether it's building intuitive front-end interfaces or robust back-end systems, I'm always up for a challenge.

### 🛠️ My Tech Stack
Here's a look at the tools and technologies I've been working with:

- **Languages**: TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, HTML5, CSS3
- **Front-End**: React, Redux, Next.js, React Native, Tailwind CSS, Sass/SCSS, styled-components, Bootstrap
- **Back-End**: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, GraphQL, WebSocket, Sanity
- **Testing**: Jest, Playwright, Cypress
- **DevOps**: Git, Deployment, CI/CD, Cloud Services, Expo

### 🌱 What I'm Learning
Right now, I’m focused on mastering containerization with Docker and diving into PostgreSQL to expand my database management skills. These tools are critical for modern, scalable application development, and I'm excited to integrate them into my workflow.

### 📫 Let's Connect
I’m excited to connect with fellow developers, collaborate on projects, and share knowledge. Feel free to check out my repositories, or even just drop me a message. Let’s create something amazing together!
